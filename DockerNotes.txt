We have the yaml file in this directory that draw the shape of the containers
we have three containers(frontend, backend, and mySQL), all of them are grouped under one name, so when the docker start, all the containers start at a specific order to assure success start
in each technology(backend, frontend) there is a docker file that controls the container of the tech.

make sure to change the env variables in the backend(nodejs) env file to be compatible with the variables in the yaml file

-->docker-compose down -v 
 (It cleans everything, including persistent data in volumes (like your MySQL database data).
Use it if you want a fresh reset, but be careful â€” you'll lose data stored in volumes unless it's backed up.)


-->docker-compose up --build
(Does two things:
--build: Forces Docker to rebuild the images for your services (from the Dockerfile), even if they were previously built.
up:
Builds (if needed), creates, and starts the containers.

Also attaches the logs to your terminal (unless you add -d for detached mode).)


-->docker-compose stop
(stop the containers)


-->docker-compose start
(start the containers)

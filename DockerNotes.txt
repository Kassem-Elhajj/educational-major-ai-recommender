make sure to change the env variables in the backend(nodejs) env file to be compatible with the variables in the yaml file

-->docker-compose down -v 
 (It cleans everything, including persistent data in volumes (like your MySQL database data).
Use it if you want a fresh reset, but be careful â€” you'll lose data stored in volumes unless it's backed up.)


-->docker-compose up --build
(Does two things:
--build: Forces Docker to rebuild the images for your services (from the Dockerfile), even if they were previously built.
up:
Builds (if needed), creates, and starts the containers.

Also attaches the logs to your terminal (unless you add -d for detached mode).)


-->docker-compose stop
(stop the containers)


-->docker-compose start
(start the containers)
